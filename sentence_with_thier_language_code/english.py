english_text="""Noting that the NTA has “outstretched itself to accommodate diverse requests from many test indenting agencies” including taking up recruitment tests, the panel has suggested that the agency should primarily conduct entrance exams till its capacity is augmented.

Since it was established in 2018, the NTA has administered 244 tests, and the number of candidates registered for the tests has almost doubled from an average of 67 lakh per year during 2019-2021 to 122 lakh per year in 2022-23. In addition to entrance exams, the NTA currently conducts exams for recruitment in central universities.

The panel also noted the NTA’s “high dependence” on service providers and outsourced agencies to conduct exams. The panel has recommended that the NTA Director General be assisted by two additional directors general, and directors assigned to specific tasks, and said that the agency should be staffed with “domain-specific human resources” and a “leadership team with domain knowledge”.

Involve state, district officials
The panel has suggested involving state and district-level authorities “in the way elections are conducted”. Specifically, it has recommended setting up coordination committees at these levels comprising officials of the NTA, the National Informatics Centre (NIC), police, and the Intelligence Bureau. These committees would prepare strategies to ensure transparent and fair exams, identify testing centres, and ensure safe transportation of question papers with security from the police or paramilitary forces.

The panel has suggested that test centres be sealed in the presence of district administration and police before an exam, and that these centres be guarded till they are de-sealed for the exam — much like polling booths. The panel has also recommended CCTV monitoring of testing centres.

Like polls have presiding officers, the panel has suggested having a “presiding officer” from the NTA to be the overall in-charge of the test in a centre.

Improving testing process
The panel has recommended multi-session testing, spread over a few days to a couple of weeks. For NEET-UG, it has suggested multi-stage testing (like JEE Main and Advanced).

To prevent “suspicious and unusual” allocation of testing centres, it has suggested adherence to a testing centre allocation policy in which candidates will be assigned a testing centre in their district. Each district should have a testing centre, with mobile testing centres for rural or remote areas, according to the panel.
For pen-and-paper exams, the panel’s recommendations include setting more than three sets of question papers, and sending encrypted question papers to confidential servers at testing centres where they can then be printed. Another model suggested is delivering the question paper via computer to each candidate, with the candidates then recording responses in an OMR sheet.

To verify the authenticity of a candidate, the panel has suggested a “Digi-Exam” system, much like DigiYatra, where the primary data identifying the candidate is recorded at the application stage, and their biometrics are verified at the testing centre.

Long-term measures
The panel has suggested “harmonization and unification of tests” for admissions at the undergraduate level. This would include having a uniform eligibility and admission criteria, number of sessions, mode of testing, among other things.

The panel has also recommended the migration to “computer adaptive testing” — instead of the same set of questions being offered to everybody, in computer-adaptive testing a candidate is shown questions based on her ability, which is determined and updated based on responses during the test. With testees getting different combinations of questions, such a mode improves security and helps better assess individual capabilities.
Noting that computer-based tests (CBT) “has now become the preferred mode of examination and a sure way forward”, the panel has also recommended that the NTA collaborate with Kendriya Vidyalayas and Navodaya Vidyalayas to develop digital infrastructure that will allow them to serve as computer-based testing centres.

The panel has said that “a nationwide network of about 400-500 testing centres” be established “within a time frame of a year or so, which will provide about 2.0-2.5 lakh testing capacity for conducting CBT in one session nationwide”.
Shimla: Underlining that the audit profession is based on a sacred trust, Himachal Pradesh governor Shiv Pratap Shukla said on Wednesday that the accuracy, integrity, and transparency with which auditors carry out their duties directly influence the strength of democratic institutions, the quality of governance, and the trust the public places in the financial system. Inaugurating the opening ceremony of the officer trainees of the 2024 batch of the Indian Audit and Accounts Services (IAAS) and the celebration of 75 years of the National Academy of Audit and Accounts in Shimla, the governor emphasised the importance of values and skills and said that the ethical foundation of their work was paramount.
"The integrity with which you approach your duties would safeguard the public interest and ensure that the funds allocated for social welfare, infrastructure development and other essential services are used for their intended purposes," he added. The governor said that this institution was founded with the vision of creating a dedicated, competent, and ethical cadre of public servants capable of addressing the challenges of our nation and serving the people with distinction.

4 bills tabled on 1st day; BJP moves adjournment motion
Dharamshala: Four bills, including the Land Ceiling Amendment Bill, were tabled on the first day of the Winter Session of the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly on Wednesday, even as the BJP tried to corner the state govt on the issue of corruption by moving an adjournment motion.
The Ceiling on Land Holdings Amendment Bill, 2024, was introduced in the assembly by revenue minister Jagat Singh Negi, and will enable Radha Soami Satsang Beas (RSSB) to transfer its land and building of Bhota charitable hospital to its sister organization Jagat Singh Medical Relief Society. The bill allows the transfer of land, and structure for religious, spiritual or charitable purposes, subject to a maximum limit of 30 acres. The amendment was necessitated as the RSSB was not able to transfer its land and had in November temporarily shut the hospital, sparking off protests from residents of Hamirpur against the closure. The RSSB is running a 75-bed hospital situated on 44 acres of land, in Bhota, Hamirpur. The other bills, which were tabled in the assembly, are Himachal Pradesh Panchayati Raj (amendment) Bill, Himachal Pradesh Police (amendment) Bill and Himachal Pradesh Recruitment and Conditions of Services Bill. Earlier, the winter session started with BJP legislators demanding a debate under Rule 67 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business of the Assembly. After Speaker Kuldeep Pathania gave his consent to the adjournment motion with chief minister Sukhvinder Sukhu also agreeing to the BJP’s demand, the first day’s scheduled business was suspended and a stormy debate ensued on corruption with both Opposition and ruling MLAs levelling allegations against each other’s govts. Starting the debate, BJP MLA from Naina Devi constituency in Bilaspur, Randhir Sharma, accused the state government of indulging in corruption during its two years of rule. Sharma alleged corruption in the excise policy, in a land deal and in the distribution of relief money to the victims of monsoon disaster of last year etc.
BJP MLAs including Satpal Satti, Balbir Singh Verma, Surender Shourie and Vinod Kumar also levelled allegations of corruption at various levels of governance. Replying to the allegations, Sukhu said that BJP legislators should support their allegations with proof. “The government has consented to the Opposition’s demand for a debate. It’s good that we are having a debate. But the legislators have no proof to support their allegations. Moreover, how serious the BJP is regarding these allegations can be gauged from the fact the Leader of Opposition is not even present in the House,” Sukhu replied while pointing towards the seat of Jai Ram Thakur. “This government does not tolerate corruption and will not spare the corrupt, provided there is proof,” added Sukhu. A number of Congress MLAs including Sanjay Awasthy, Ashish Butail, Bhawani Singh Pathania, Suresh Kumar, defended the government while levelling counter allegations of corruption against the BJP during its rule.
The four bills were tabled in the post-lunch session, when most of the BJP legislators, including the Leader of Opposition Jai Ram Thakur were not present in the House. Later during the debate, Thakur demanded that the tabled bills be withdrawn as no business was allowed during adjournment motion under Rule 67. However, Speaker Pathania told the House that as a Speaker, he had the privilege to allow the introduction of the bills.

BELAGAVI: Chaos erupted in the Karnataka legislative assembly on Thursday after Congress legislators accused Union home minister Amit Shah of making controversial remarks about B R Ambedkar, the architect of the Indian Constitution.
The ruckus began during a discussion on maternal deaths in Ballari and other parts of the state when opposition leader R Ashoka was addressing the House. Congress MLA H C Balakrishna interrupted Ashoka, expressing his intention to move a resolution regarding the alleged comments attributed to Shah.
— ANI (@ANI)

This led to a dramatic escalation, with several Congress MLAs standing up, holding photographs of Ambedkar, and raising slogans against the BJP. The legislators demanded an explanation and urged the govt to condemn the alleged remarks.

Speaker U T Khader tried to restore order, repeatedly urging members to let the proceedings continue, but his efforts were in vain. BJP legislators countered the Congress's allegations, accusing the opposition of trying to derail the discussion on maternal health.
Amid the uproar, Congress MLAs argued that Shah’s remarks were an insult to Ambedkar’s legacy and called for the assembly to take a united stand against such statements. The BJP dismissed the claims, stating there was no evidence of Shah making any such comments.
As tempers flared, the session was adjourned temporarily to allow the members to cool down. Speaking to the media later, Congress leaders reiterated their demand for a resolution condemning Shah’s alleged remarks, while BJP leaders accused the opposition of politicising unrelated issues.
The session is expected to end today, with the Speaker hoping for a calmer atmosphere to discuss legislative business in the second half after lunch.

Historically, the English novel has generally been seen as beginning with Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719) and Moll Flanders (1722),[1] though modern scholarship cites Aphra Behn's Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister (1684) John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress (1678) and Aphra Behn's Oroonoko (1688) as more likely contenders, while earlier works such as Sir Thomas Malory's Morte d'Arthur (1485), and even the "Prologue" to Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (c. 1400) have been suggested.[2] Another important early novel is Gulliver's Travels (1726, amended 1735), by Irish writer and clergyman Jonathan Swift, which is both a satire of human nature, as well as a parody of travellers' tales like Robinson Crusoe.[3] The rise of the novel as an important literary genre is generally associated with the growth of the middle class in England.

Other major 18th-century English novelists are Samuel Richardson (1689–1761), author of the epistolary novels Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (1740) and Clarissa; or, The History of a Young Lady (1747–48); Henry Fielding (1707–1754), who wrote Joseph Andrews (1742) and The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling (1749); Laurence Sterne (1713–1768), who published Tristram Shandy in parts between 1759 and 1767;[4] Oliver Goldsmith (1728–1774), author of The Vicar of Wakefield (1766); Tobias Smollett (1721–1771), a Scottish novelist best known for his comic picaresque novels, such as The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle (1751) and The Expedition of Humphry Clinker (1771), who influenced Charles Dickens;[5] and Fanny Burney (1752–1840), whose novels "were enjoyed and admired by Jane Austen," wrote Evelina (1778), Cecilia (1782) and Camilla (1796).[6]

A noteworthy aspect of both the 18th- and 19th- century novel is the way the novelist directly addressed the reader. For example, the author might interrupt his or her narrative to pass judgment on a character, or pity or praise another, and inform or remind the reader of some other relevant issue.[citation needed]

Romantic period[edit]
Main article: Romantic literature in English

Sir Walter Scott
The phrase 'Romantic novel' has several possible meanings. Here it refers to novels written during the Romantic era in literary history, which runs from the late 18th century until the beginning of the Victorian era in 1837. But to complicate matters there are novels written in the romance tradition by novelists like Walter Scott, Nathaniel Hawthorne, George Meredith.[7] In addition the phrase today is mostly used to refer to the popular pulp-fiction genre that focusses on romantic love. The Romantic period is especially associated with the poets William Blake, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, George Byron, Percy Shelley and John Keats, though two major novelists, Jane Austen and Walter Scott, also published in the early 19th century.

Horace Walpole's 1764 novel, The Castle of Otranto, invented the Gothic fiction genre. The word gothic was originally used in the sense of medieval.[8] This genre combines "the macabre, fantastic, and supernatural" and usually involves haunted castles, graveyards and various picturesque elements.[9] Later novelist Ann Radcliffe introduced the brooding figure of the Gothic villain which developed into the Byronic hero. Her most popular and influential work, The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794), is frequently described as the archetypal Gothic novel. Vathek (1786), by William Beckford, and The Monk (1796), by Matthew Lewis, were further notable early works in both the Gothic and horror genres.

Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein (1818), as another important Gothic novel as well as being an early example of science fiction.[10] The vampire genre fiction began with John William Polidori's The Vampyre (1819). This short story was inspired by the life of Lord Byron and his poem The Giaour. An important later work is Varney the Vampire (1845), where many standard vampire conventions originated: Varney has fangs, leaves two puncture wounds on the neck of his victims, and has hypnotic powers and superhuman strength. Varney was also the first example of the "sympathetic vampire", who loathes his condition but is a slave to it.[11]


Mary Shelley
Among more minor novelists in this period Maria Edgeworth (1768–1849) and Thomas Love Peacock (1785–1866) are worthy of comment. Edgeworth's novel Castle Rackrent (1800) is "the first fully developed regional novel in English" as well as "the first true historical novel in English" and an important influence on Walter Scott.[12] Peacock was primarily a satirist in novels such as Nightmare Abbey (1818) and The Misfortunes of Elphin (1829).

Jane Austen's (1775–1817) works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism.[13] Her plots, though fundamentally comic, highlight the dependence of women on marriage to secure social standing and economic security.[14] Austen brings to light the hardships women faced, who usually did not inherit money, could not work and where their only chance in life depended on the man they married. She reveals not only the difficulties women faced in her day, but also what was expected of men and of the careers they had to follow. This she does with wit and humour and with endings where all characters, good or bad, receive exactly what they deserve. Her work brought her little personal fame and only a few positive reviews during her lifetime, but the publication in 1869 of her nephew's A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced her to a wider public, and by the 1940s she had become accepted as a major writer. The second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of Austen scholarship and the emergence of a Janeite fan culture. Austen's works include Pride and Prejudice (1813) Sense and Sensibility (1811), Mansfield Park, Persuasion and Emma.

The other major novelist at the beginning of the early 19th century was Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832), who was not only a highly successful British novelist but "the greatest single influence on fiction in the 19th century ... [and] a European figure".[15] Scott established the genre of the historical novel with his series of Waverley Novels, including Waverley (1814), The Antiquary (1816), and The Heart of Midlothian (1818).[16] However, Austen is today widely read and the source for films and television series, while Scott is less often read.

Victorian novel[edit]
It was in the Victorian era (1837–1901) that the novel became the leading literary genre in English. A number of women novelists were successful in the 19th century, although they often had to use a masculine pseudonym. At the beginning of the 19th century most novels were published in three volumes. However, monthly serialization was revived with the publication of Charles Dickens' Pickwick Papers in twenty parts between April 1836 and November 1837. Demand was high for each episode to introduce some new element, whether it was a plot twist or a new character, so as to maintain the readers' interest. Both Dickens and Thackeray frequently published this way.[17]

After Carlyle, the poetic, prophetic, and visionary possibilities of the novel are fully awakened.[18]

– Kathleen Tillotson, British scholar
In the 1830s and '40s, novelists began to show the influence of social critics on their work, especially Thomas Carlyle, who raised the "Condition-of-England Question" to describe "the social and political upheavals which followed the Reform Act of 1832".[19] In response, novelists wrote "Condition of England novels", which were in many ways a reaction to rapid industrialization, and the social, political and economic issues associated with it, and were a means of commenting on abuses of government and industry and the suffering of the poor, who were not profiting from England's economic prosperity.[20] Stories of the working-class poor were directed toward the middle class to help create sympathy and promote change. An early example is Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist (1837–38).


Charles Dickens
Charles Dickens emerged on the literary scene in the 1830s with the two novels already mentioned. Dickens wrote vividly about London life and struggles of the poor, but in a good-humoured fashion, accessible to readers of all classes. One of his most popular works to this day is A Christmas Carol (1843). In more recent years Dickens has been most admired for his later novels, such as Dombey and Son (1846–48), Great Expectations (1860–61), Bleak House (1852–53), Little Dorrit (1855–57), and Our Mutual Friend (1864–65). An early rival to Dickens was William Makepeace Thackeray, who during the Victorian period ranked second only to him, but he is now much less read and is known almost exclusively for Vanity Fair (1847). In that novel he satirizes whole swaths of humanity while retaining a light touch. It features his most memorable character, the engagingly roguish Becky Sharp.

The Brontë sisters were other significant novelists in the 1840s and 1850s. Their novels caused a sensation when they were first published and were subsequently accepted as classics. They had written compulsively from early childhood and were first published, at their own expense, in 1846 as poets under the pseudonyms Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. The sisters returned to prose, producing a novel each the following year: Charlotte's Jane Eyre, Emily's Wuthering Heights and Anne's Agnes Grey. Later, Anne's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (1848) and Charlotte's Villette (1853) were published. Elizabeth Gaskell was also a successful writer and her first novel, Mary Barton, was published anonymously in 1848. Gaskell's North and South contrasts the lifestyle in the industrial north of England with the wealthier south. Even though her writing conforms to Victorian conventions, Gaskell usually frames her stories as critiques of contemporary attitudes: her early works focused on factory work in the Midlands. She always emphasised the role of women, with complex narratives and dynamic female characters.[21]

Anthony Trollope (1815–82) was one of the most successful, prolific, and respected English novelists of the Victorian era. Some of his best-loved works are set in the imaginary county of Barsetshire, including The Warden (1855) and Barchester Towers (1857). He also wrote perceptive novels on political, social, and gender issues, and on other topical matters, including The Way with Live Now (1875). Trollope's novels portrayed the lives of the landowning and professional classes of early Victorian England.

George Eliot's (Mary Ann Evans) (1819–80) first novel Adam Bede was published in 1859. Her works, especially Middlemarch 1871–72), are important examples of literary realism, and are admired for their combination of high Victorian literary detail combined with an intellectual breadth that removes them from the narrow geographic confines they often depict.


H. G. Wells studying in London, taken c. 1890
An interest in rural matters and the changing social and economic situation of the countryside is seen in the novels of Thomas Hardy (1840–1928). A Victorian realist, in the tradition of George Eliot, he was also influenced both in his novels and poetry by Romanticism, especially by William Wordsworth.[22] Charles Darwin is another important influence on Thomas Hardy.[23] Like Charles Dickens he was also highly critical of much in Victorian society, though Hardy focused more on a declining rural society. While Hardy wrote poetry throughout his life and regarded himself primarily as a poet, his first collection was not published until 1898, so that initially he gained fame as the author of such novels as, Far from the Madding Crowd (1874), The Mayor of Casterbridge (1886), Tess of the d'Urbervilles (1891), and Jude the Obscure (1895). He ceased writing novels following adverse criticism of this last novel. In novels such as The Mayor of Casterbridge and Tess of the d'Urbervilles Hardy attempts to create modern works in the genre of tragedy, that are modelled on the Greek drama, especially Aeschylus and Sophocles, though in prose, not poetry, a novel not drama, and with characters of low social standing, not nobility.[24] Another significant late 19th-century novelist is George Gissing (1857–1903) who published 23 novels between 1880 and 1903. His best known novel is New Grub Street (1891).[citation needed]

Important developments occurred in genre fiction in this era. Although pre-dated by John Ruskin's The King of the Golden River in 1841, the history of the modern fantasy genre is generally said to begin with George MacDonald, the influential author of The Princess and the Goblin and Phantastes (1858). William Morris was a popular English poet who also wrote several fantasy novels during the latter part of the nineteenth century. Wilkie Collins' epistolary novel The Moonstone (1868), is generally considered the first detective novel in the English language, while The Woman in White is regarded as one of the finest sensation novels.

Wells's (1866–1946) writing career began in the 1890s with science fiction novels like The Time Machine (1895), and The War of the Worlds (1898) which describes an invasion of late Victorian England by Martians. Wells is seen, along with Frenchman Jules Verne (1828–1905), as inventing the scientific romance. He also wrote realistic fiction about the lower middle class in novels such as Kipps (1905) and The History of Mr Polly (1910).

20th century[edit]
The major novelists writing in Britain at the start of the 20th century were an Irishman James Joyce (1882–1941) and two immigrants, American Henry James (1843–1916) and Pole Joseph Conrad (1857–1924)[citation needed]. The modernist tradition in the novel, with its emphasis "towards the ever more minute and analytic exposition of mental life", begins with James and Conrad, in novels such as The Ambassadors (1903), The Golden Bowl (1904) and Lord Jim (1900).[25] Other important early modernists were Dorothy Richardson (1873–1957), whose novel Pointed Roof (1915), is one of the earliest example of the stream of consciousness technique, and D. H. Lawrence (1885–1930), who wrote with understanding about the social life of the lower and middle classes and the personal life of those who could not adapt to the social norms of his time. Sons and Lovers (1913), is widely regarded as his earliest masterpiece. There followed The Rainbow (1915), though it was immediately seized by the police, and its sequel Women in Love published in 1920.[26] Lawrence attempted to explore human emotions more deeply than his contemporaries and challenged the boundaries of the acceptable treatment of sexual issues, most notably in Lady Chatterley's Lover, which was privately published in Florence in 1928. However, the unexpurgated version of this novel was not published until 1959.[27] In 1922 Irishman James Joyce's important modernist novel Ulysses appeared. Set during one day in Dublin in June 1904, the novel has been called "a demonstration and summation of the entire movement."[28] In it Joyce creates parallels with Homer's epic poem the Odyssey.[29]

Another significant modernist in the 1920 was Virginia Woolf (1882–1941), who was an influential feminist, member of the Bloomsbury Group, and a major stylistic innovator associated with the stream-of-consciousness technique. Her novels include Mrs Dalloway (1925), To the Lighthouse (1927), Orlando: A Biography (1928), and The Waves (1931). Her essay collection A Room of One's Own (1929) contains her famous dictum: "A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction".[30]
He had the privilege of having been associated very closely with Acharya Narendra Dev. He was elected Secretary of the District Praja Socialist Party, Ballia. Within a year, he was elected Joint Secretary of the U.P.State Praja Socialist Party.
Ever since he assumed office in May 2014, PM Modi has embarked on a journey of all-round and inclusive development where every Indian can realize their hopes and aspirations. He remains deeply inspired by the principle of ‘Antyodaya’, of serving the last person in the queue. 
Through innovative ideas and initiatives, the Government has ensured that the wheels of progress move at rapid pace and the fruits of development reach every citizen. Governance has become open, easier and transparent.
The following report of an interview which a Mr. S.W. Clemens, of Meerut, had with Mahatma Gandhi early in 1920, appeared in the Indian Witness, a Christian journal published in Lucknow :
Gajaraj is a bright little boy of nine. His widowed mother joined the Ashram (at Sevagram) some time back. The boy was put to school in the Nai Talim Shala of Shri Aryanayakam. He agreed to attend school but on condition that Gandhiji would pay a visit to it. "Not to your school," Gandhiji replied, "but I will come and visit the dormitory in the hostel, where you are to sleep." Accordingly two days before he left Sevagram (in December 1945) he paid the promised visit.

"What I saw this morning made my sight, ache," he wrote in a note which he addressed to the school authorities before he left Sevagram, summing up his impressions of his visit. In front of the room which was used for the children's dispensary he found the ground all wet. On inquiry he found that the children washed their hands and faces there. In the dormitory where the children slept the mats were untidily kept. A pen and inkstand had been left lying on a mat in the middle of the room. He examined the ink-pots and the pens. They were messy. He opened one of the beddings. The bed clothes were unwashed. The bed-sheet was torn in many places and an indifferent attempt at mending had been made only at a few. The stuffing in the mattress had become limpy and hard from long use. Under the mattress was a heap of unwashed rags. Bamboo screens had been put up in the verandah to provide extra accommodation for more students.

He had intended to give not more than five minutes to the visit. He actually spent three-quarters of an hour in inspecting and explaining things to the superintendent of the hostel.

"There should have been a receptacle to collect the water from the ablutions at the foot of the tree. Otherwise much precious water is wasted. Besides it breeds mosquitoes. The torn bed-sheet should have been patched up or doubled and turned into a quilt. I did much blanket quilting whilst I was in prison in the Transvaal. Such blankets are warm and lasting. Torn rags should not be treated as waste. They should be properly washed and kept. They can be used for mending clothes and in a variety of other ways.

"Some boys, I found, had not sufficient winter clothing. Why should not those who have more than their requirements be taught to part with their superfluous clothing for those who were insufficiently provided? That would be a fine object-lesson in mutual aid.

"And why bamboo screens in the verandah? A verandah is meant to let in air and sunshine. The screens shut both out. I was told this was done to improvise accommodation for more students, but then why admit more students than there is accommodation for?

"All these may appear to be trifles," he proceeded, "but all things are made up of trifles. My entire life has been built on trifles. To the extent that we have neglected to inculcate attention to details on our boys we have failed. Rather I should say, I have failed. For it was I who launched the experiment of Nai Talim but could not find time to conduct it myself and had to leave it to others.

"A sense of cleanliness, tidiness and sanitation, in my opinion, constitutes the very core of Nai Talim. To cultivate it involves no expense. All it needs is a keen, observant eye and an artistic sense. If you tell me that in this way you cannot do justice to more than one or two boys," he concluded, "I will say 'then have one or two and no more.' By undertaking more than we can properly manage we introduce into our soul the taint of untruth."
Gandhiji believed in Nature Cure. Dietetics also interested him. There was no suggestion that he would throw it away as useless unless it was tried fully and gave unfavourable results. He would conduct the experiment on himself so that he could get first-hand information about the pros and cons of the experiment. Here is what he described in Young India (13-6-'29) as his experiments with uncooked food :

"I have been known as a crank, faddist, madman. Evidently the reputation is well deserved. For, wherever I go, I draw to myself cranks, faddists, and madmen. Andhra has a fair share of these. They often find their way to Sabarmati. No wonder then that I found these specimens in abundance during my Andhra tour. But I propose to introduce to the reader only the fellow crank who by his living faith in his mission compelled my admiration and induced me to plunge into a dietetic experiment which I had left unfinished at the age of twenty when I was a student in London. This is Sundaram Gopalrav of Rajahmundry. The ground was prepared for him by a survey superintendent whom I met in Vizagapatam and who told me that he was living practically on raw food. Gopalrav has a Nature Cure establishment in Rajahmundry, to which he devotes all his time. He said to me, 'The hipbaths and kindred appliances are good so far as they go. But they are artificial. To be rid of disease it is necessary to do away with fire in the preparation of foods. We must take everything in its vital state even as animals do.'

'Would you advise me to adopt entirely raw diet ?' I asked.

'Certainly, why not? I have cured cases of chronic dyspepsia in old men and women through a balanced diet containing germinated seeds,' was Gopalrav's reply.

'But surely there should be a transition stage,' I gently remonstrated.

'No such stage is necessary,' rejoined Gopalrav. 'Uncooked food including uncooked starch and protein are any day more digestible than cooked. Try it and you will feel all the better for it.'

'Do you take the risk ? If the cremation ceremony takes place in Andhra, the people will cremate your body with mine,' I said.

'I take the risk,' said Gopalrav.

'Then send me your soaked wheat. I commence from today,' I said.

Poor Gopalrav sent the soaked wheat. Kasturba not knowing that it could possibly be meant for me gave it to the volunteers who finished it. So I had to commence the experiment the next day."

Gandhiji subsequently gave up the experiment as it had unfavourable effect on his health.
The significance and gradual development of the system of mass prayers evolved by him was explained by Mahatmaji in one of his speeches at Sodepur Ashram in December 1945. He said that in 1936 about a dozen Japanese monks paid him a visit when he was staying at Maganvadi (Wardha). The leading monk suggested to him that he intended to send one or two of his disciples to the Ashram, a proposal which he approved. First came one and later on another. Of the two, one was staying with him till the war with Japan broke out and as a result he was taken into custody. This Buddhist monk used to do all the tasks he used to be given punctually and methodically. In between his work he used to spend the time at his disposal in singing religious songs in the Japanese language, all the time beating a drum. This he did while taking his rounds. This was a Buddhist religious song in praise of the Infinite. Gandhiji said that he incorporated the song in his prayer. This was the first item of the prayer.

The second item of the prayer was a Sanskrit Shloka (verse) and was, according to him, universal in its appeal. This was an invocation to Mother Earth, sustainer of man. If there was any objection to it on any score he would plead that he was helpless. To him all faiths were welcome. He believed in all faiths but he saw no reason to give up his own faith. Possibly, said Gandhiji, this Sanskrit Shloka was symbolic but, according to him, many noble thoughts and ideas were couched in symbolic language.

Thirdly, there was the prayer quoted from the Koran. It was incorporated at the instance of the daughter of Abbas Tyabji, the well-known Congress leader. She possessed a gifted voice. When on a visit to the Ashram she expressed the desire to propagate the teaching of the Koran to the Ashramites, Gandhiji said, he readily agreed. She suggested a verse from the Koran for inclusion in the prayer and it was done.

The fourth item of the prayer was taken from the Zend Avesta written in the Pahlavi language. When he was fasting in the Aga Khan Palace, Dr. Gilder was there as were also Dr. Bidhan Roy and some other medical men. Dr. Gilder was a Parsi and from him the verse from the Zend Avesta was taken and included.

So far as the Bhajan songs were concerned, said Gandhiji, there was no hard and fast rule. It all depended upon the time and place of the prayer.
Under this caption Gandhiji wrote as follows in Young India :

"Among the many curious inquiries I receive, here are some from a correspondent in Guntur District. People say Gandhiji does not do what he says. He preaches poverty, but possesses property. He wants others to become poor, but he is not poor. He advocates simple and inexpensive life yet he is expensive. So, answer the questions below: 'Do you take anything from the A.I.G.C. or Gujarat Congress Committee for your living and touring expenses ? If so what is the amount ? If not, how are you meeting the expenses for your long tours and your food and clothing if you are, as people take you to be, a propertyless man ?' There is much more in the letter of the same kind, but I have taken out the most salient points.

"I do make the claim that I attempt to act as I preach. But I must confess that I am not as inexpensive in my wants as I would like to be. My food since my illness costs more than it should. By no means can I call it a poor man's food. My travels too cost more than they did before my illness. I am no longer able to travel long distances third class. Nor ; do I travel as I did before without a companion. All this means not simplicity and poverty but the reverse of it. I draw nothings from the A.I.C.C. or the .Gujarat Committee. But friends find my travelling expenses including food and clothing. Often during my tours railway tickets are purchased by those who invite me and my host everywhere covers me with kind attention which often embarrasses me. People present me during my tours with much more Khaddar than I need. The balance goes to clothe those who need it or it is put in the general Khaddar stock of the Ashram which is conducted in the public interest. I own no property and yet I feel that I am perhaps the richest man in the world. For I have never been in want either for myself or for my public concerns. God has always and invariably responded in time. I can recall several occasions when almost the last penny had been spent for my public activities. Moneys then came in from the most unexpected quarters. These responses have made me humble and filled me with a faith in God and His goodness that will stand the strain of utter distress" if it ever becomes my lot in life. It is open to the world, therefore, to laugh at dispossessing myself of all property. "For me the dispossession has been a positive gain. I would like people to compete with me in my contentment. It is the richest treasure I own. Hence it is perhaps right to say that though I preach poverty, I am a rich man."
Yes. By the way, another correction -- I think Yusuf Hamied was also in Cathedral School.

He didn't come from Campion but he was in Cathedral. It is a little difficult to remember who was where.

There was Dinshaw Pundole who was a classmate. He was a major squash player and ended up being the owner of Duke's drinks which was later sold to Coke.

In those days, we were just a bunch of fun-loving kids who were friends. We didn't have any of the animosity to contend with (laughs).

Then I went to the US. I had to go to a prep school for a year because the College Board exams could not be taken in India at that time.

Now you can take them here. I went to Cornell University. My father wanted me to become an engineer; so I spent two years at Cornell as an engineering student, didn't like it and switched to architecture -- which is what I wanted to do -- and graduated as an architect.

I went on to complete structural engineering, which was more to my liking and interest, rather than mechanical engineering, and graduated.

I had a very happy time at Cornell; the five-year course for the architecture degree, along with the two-year structural engineering programme, made it seven years.

Mainly because architecture design is a five-year degree course and you cannot get a credit for anything, you have to go through the full five years.

So I had a happy time at Cornell; the only thing I did not like was the cold weather.

It was something that I never got used to and, probably, never will. However warm you dress, you were never warm enough.

So after I graduated, I wanted to be in some place where it was warmer and ended up in Los Angeles in an architect's office.

I would not have come back to India, since I was very happy there. But my grandmother fell ill and she asked for me; so I came back. And one thing led to another and I stayed here indefinitely because she continued to be ill.

One day, J R D Tata called me and said that I should be with the group even if it was temporary. So I was sent to Jamshedpur and spent six months with Telco (now Tata Motors).

 December 1962 to early 1963. Those six months, at that time, were horrible. But, looking back, I think they were very useful six months. I spent time in different departments on the shop floor of Telco.

It was horrible at that time because you had nothing to do and you can imagine being in a particular shop for a week with no assignment and no place to sit.

You can't stand still; and every time you went near a worker, he thought you were doing a time & motion study.

He didn't know whether you were looking over his shoulders, when all you were trying to do is to learn, since you had nothing else to do.

So it was a horrible six months. But looking back on it, I developed a wide knowledge base, which surprises some people.

They wonder how I know about heat treatment or milling or something... it is because I spent six months in the company.

The Pune plant did not exist at that time or probably was in the process of being built.

At the end of those six months, I vowed that I would never work in Telco and I was moved to Tata Steel.

What did you want to do at that point of time?

In fact, at that point of time, all I wanted to do was a job. And I was being sent on endless training or induction programmes.

Somewhere during the time I was in Jamshedpur, my grandmother (Navjibai) died.

So I felt free to return to the US; in fact, on two or three occasions I almost did that. I didn't really have anything that I wanted to do.

I only wanted to have a job that I could be responsible for. In some ways, I did that for two years at Tata Steel.

I again spent some time on the shop floor, and I went through various departments, but on a much more organised basis.

I didn't have that same sense of not having anything to do. It was quite structured and I was attached to the superintendent of each department and I used to be given many minuscule, unimportant assignments; but assignments nevertheless.

I then ended up in the engineering office where I really got my teeth into some reasonable projects, one of which is Tata Steel's growth shop today.

There were several major projects at Tata Steel, including the expansion plan. I ended up at last, as technical assistant to the managing director who was at that time called the director-in-charge of Tata Steel -- Mr Nanavati.

Then I was called back to Mumbai and a little while after that I was shipped out to Australia to set up a joint venture for Tatas.

It was with a cash rich, pastoral company with little industrial experience. The Tatas were supposed to bring in experience to forge an industrial enterprise.

We formed the joint venture and we did some business; but obviously their thrust was on farm-related work and they were not interested in the projects we put up. I came back.

The joint venture stayed on for about two years and was then wound up, as I had thought it would be.

I came back to India and did a small stint with TCS at that time. This was in 1971. It was the early days of software exports.

Actually it wasn't software; it was something totally different. We had documents coming in from the US and they would be converted into punch cards and sent out.

That was the extent of the software -- document transfer from paper to punch card.

TCS, at that time, had hundreds of punch-card operators who were converting documents into invoices and other things that could be processed.

The good thing was that everything was being done within 24 hours and sent back to the US. I was involved in that when it had just started. Mr S Ramadorai had not still joined.

After TCS, I was made the director-in-charge of Nelco (The National Radio & Electronics Company) which, at that time, was losing a large amount of money.

For some reason, Nelco, in perception terms, is something that is held against me. Actually, it was a great success story because during my time with Nelco, we moved the market share of radios from 2% to 20%. We wiped out the losses and paid dividends.

The only thing that we didn't do (which is because we did not get any infusion of cash from the Tatas) is that we didn't really grow. The consumer electronics business needed a lot of cash to grow.
I was involved in Nelco from 1971 to 1984. I can't remember the figures... but you would see that during that period, Nelco's revenues went up, it wiped out the losses, the market share of products went up, and we started manufacturing televisions sets.

Importantly, we also went into industrial electronics. Wipro and Nelco were the only two manufacturers of minicomputers.

We went into drives, process control equipment and inverters which later got sold to Liebert. But, for some reason, everybody thought Nelco was a failure; in a way, it was a failure, only because it did not grow to become the number one electronics manufacturer in the country, because we didn't infuse cash.

Part of that was because, with the exception of J R D Tata, everybody thought that radios were not the business that the Tatas should be in.

Even though later on it became a television manufacturer?

By the time we were given a licence to manufacture television sets, so was everybody else. At that time ECIL (Electronics Corporation of India Limited) was the only major company allowed to manufacture TV sets; otherwise, only small-scale units were permitted. So our big growth was in industrial electronics. I was in that until 1984.
Yeah. Around 1982, my mother was diagnosed as having cancer and I had just been made the chairman of Tata Industries, which was more of a titular thing, because there was nothing in Tata Industries; it was a shell company from the erstwhile managing agency days.

So I thought, well, why not sit down and make a strategic plan? I had taken three months leave to be with my mother and I actually sat in the hospital and wrote that plan.

After she died, I came back and presented that plan. Everybody said, 'It is very nice but it is not going to happen'. That's because the plan talked about going into certain high-tech areas which were till then closed to the private sector.

The management turned down that plan. I said, 'Well, I am the chairman of Tata Industries, so why don't we go into these high-tech areas for Tata Industries?' And we did.

We entered into joint ventures with IBM, Honeywell, etc. Then, in 1984, Rajiv (the late former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi) came into power.

It had no bearing on my plan, but it was as though he had the same view. So certain areas began to be opened up for the private sector.

Telecom opened up -- you were able to produce PABXs and telecom instruments. So we got into those areas.

Areas that were in my plan such as VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) communications didn't get passed at that time, but the groundwork for that got done.

Some parts of the telecom sector were opened up instead of saying that ITI (Indian Telephone Industries) would be the only manufacturer.

The government also said that the main exchanges would come from different sources. So it became very exciting.

Everybody looks at the 1990s as the period when reforms started, but actually they started during Mrs Gandhi's (Indira Gandhi) time and Rajiv took it further.

I had established, not a close relationship but a very exciting relationship with Rajiv Gandhi in terms of trying to do things in the country.

We were exchanging ideas and he was actually executing many of them.

Those were the days when Arun Singh and Arun Nehru were his advisors.

I think, if I look back, those were probably the most exciting days of my career in India -- the early days of Rajiv's prime ministership. I was very fortunate to be a part of that period.
The things I just talked about. For instance, if somebody said: Why can't you have broad banding of licensing? Why should you be allowed to produce only trucks of over seven tonnes?

If you have a licence for typewriters and technology becomes available for electric typewriters and electronic typewriters, why did you have to go and get a new licence each time? Why couldn't you have a licence for typewriters and include whatever typewriter technology was available?

You were heard. It is these kinds of changes that started then and were tremendously invigorating.

I remember that Nelco had a licence to manufacture 2,000 calculators; and if you produced 2,010 calculators, you could be prosecuted.

These were the kinds of issues that confounded one. You cannot set up operations for 2,000 units.

We were hit by calculators smuggled from Taiwan where they could make 10,000 pieces a month.

Those were the changes that were extremely exciting, but it sort of petered out after the first 18 months.

I was fortunate enough to have had an opportunity to exchange views with Rajiv and be a part of the small group of people he called from time to time to seek opinions on some of these areas.

Around that time, he made me the chairman of Air India. Like so many things that happened in the government, I was never asked (laughs heartily).

Rahul (Rahul Bajaj) was made chairman of Indian Airlines. At least I was in India, but Rahul was overseas.

We weren't even told that we were going to be made chairmen; it was simply announced that we had been made the chairmen of Air India and Indian Airlines, respectively.

For three years, I was in Air India. They were fairly unhappy years because during that time there was a lot of politicising of Air India which we won't go into.

The Rajan Jetley era and so on were sort of troublesome times and there were divergent views.

I wanted to resign, but Rajiv refused to let that happen. So the day he lost power, I quit.

I think I gained the ire of V P Singh who came into power and who may have thought that it was a reflection on his leadership, but it was not; it was only an issue of getting away from the political swings of Air India. Then things get a bit hazy in my mind, during that time...

The Bombay House issues of succession started appearing in the media...

There was the shoot-out at Tata Steel, there was the Telco strike with Rajan Nair... we had some troubled years.

Then there was the face-off with the V.P. Singh government when J R D Tata wrote a strong letter to V P Singh about allegations of foreign exchange violations over Tata Zug.

Yes, there was that also. Bhure Lal (former director of enforcement, foreign exchange) was heading an investigation.

I don't believe we did anything wrong and also everything was disclosed -- it was an issue of whether the child of a parent or the grand child of the parent company also needed to have the Reserve Bank's approval/permission to register or not.

The issue never really came to be proven because they couldn't find anything that we hadn't disclosed.

I think that issue revolved more around Indian Hotels rather than the Tatas because Indian Hotels had a lot of foreign operations at that time. Anyway, after that things become hazy in my mind until 1991.

Can we go back to the Air India phase? This was an airline that belonged to the Tatas (until it was nationalised by the government in 1951). The experiment to ask private sector industrialists to head it failed at that time, but do you think it could have worked under different circumstances?

At that time, it was in effect changing the board to a private sector board. Apart from me, there were several private sector people on the board.

So both Air India and Indian Airlines had private sector chairmen and a group of private sector people.

There were two problems with that model. One was that the civil aviation ministry did not wish to let go of its control.

Initially, I had considerable misunderstanding with Mr Jagdish Tytler who was the civil aviation minister then. But later, I had a very good understanding with him and had no problem at all.

I found that if you could go and explain something to him, he understood and would not stand in your way. But in the early days, the ministry representative on the board would object to everything I did.

It was a no-go kind of situation. I found a way to work around this situation, which was to go into the issue before the meeting and discuss it; that worked reasonably well.

The other thing that did not work is that Air India had become politicised and various people had developed vested interests.

The senior employees and senior managers had links with ministers or MPs. I remember the time we wanted to start non-stop flights to London.

Air India used to stop at Dubai purely because of vested interests. Dubai was only two hours away from Mumbai, but the flight crew would get two days off in Dubai and an allowance.

On the next leg to London, you got two days off; New York three days off. Every other airline was flying direct to London.

When we tried to change it, it brought all kind of forces into the forum and we were told how we were endangering the pilots' health and being inhuman and so on.

It was that kind of thing... every time we wanted to do something, there was a vested interest or a constituency that wanted us to leave it alone.

Often, the ministry was a part of it and backed some of these people. If the ministry had left the company alone, to be run by its representatives who would wear the hat of directors of that enterprise and keep its interest in mind, then I think it would work.

It works in France and some other places and it would work here; the only difference would be that, instead of reporting to a bunch of shareholders, you would report to the ministry as the owner.

You would be responsible for the results and would be given the freedom to deliver those results.

Will you tell us about taking over at Tata Sons?

All I remember is... this was J R D's room... he had developed a minor heart ailment at Jamshedpur and was hospitalised.

He was in the hospital when I came back from an overseas trip. I used to call on him every day. Then he came out of the hospital.

On a Monday, which was the day I used to meet him here, he told me that he planned to step down in my favour.

I think it was driven by his heart problem or a feeling that he was not as well as he would have liked to be.

People have asked me whether that was a surprise. Yes, it was a surprise, because at various times there were different people who were his choice of successor, which was okay by me.

In fact, all along, I had assumed that one or the other of them would be his successor.

I had only said to him, 'Don't step down in favour of different people; step down in favour of only one person so that that person would have the strength'.

So when I was chosen, I was a little surprised. When that took place, I set myself the task of restructuring the group.

Much of it was the same plan as the 1982 plan, dressed somewhat differently by McKinsey.

They did a wonderful job of representing the same plan, with one big difference; it now looked at portfolios rather than businesses.

After that, we have kind of come back to businesses. My plan looked at businesses and they were looking at portfolios and companies as investments.

This plan was accepted and we moved forward to restructure the group.

'Restructuring' is, in fact, a bad term to describe the process; that's one thing that we did not do too well.

We did a lot things; but trying to reduce the diversity of the group to a fewer number of companies, fewer number of businesses, which is what we set out to do, is something we did not achieve.

One of the reasons why we did not achieve that had to do with me. One of the first things we did when I took over was to decide what to do with Tomco (The Tata Oil Mills Company Ltd), which was losing money and had lost market share.

Its management said, if I remember the figures, that we had to invest Rs 80 crore for the next five years and we would not see any profits.

So I told J R D 'Why should we do this'? I told him, we should change the management or we should sell the company.

I said, in my plan, there is no Tata Oil Mills, no Lakme and no textiles. So I said, 'Why don't we look for a buyer for Tomco?' That buyer, of course, was Hindustan Lever (now Hindustan Unilever), the arch enemy of Tomco and its greatest competitor for many years.

The power centre within Tomco saw it as a grand betrayal of the Tata ethos. Here I had just come in and was selling the company to our greatest competitor and that too after having carved out a market in India as being the only Indian company to stand up to Levers!

My father was the managing director of Tomco for many years and did much of that building up. But there weren't many people who thought that it was a great idea.

On the other hand, we perhaps did the most dignified thing; we ensured that shareholders had a good share in place of Tomco, we got Levers to agree to a three-year, no-touch situation for all employees, suppliers and dealers with no closure of operations.

So, rather than go terminally ill, we thought this was a very dignified solution where everyone's interests were safeguarded.

If we had done it differently, we could perhaps have got more for our shares than we did, but I thought that it was a very good deal.

What I didn't take into account was the flak I'd get from the media and everyone else.

As I look back, that probably was one of the major reasons why the subsequent restructuring really slowed down and I became very sensitive to 'Can I do it in this company?'

So we went through internal restructuring -- clustering companies with the same business under one major company which were all internal arrangements. I did not even look outside.

We undertook an internal monitoring structure. What we did do successfully was to set some goals for companies to be competitive. We set some criteria for the companies.

If not, we would restructure them or divest from them, etc. We forced the companies to devise a strategy for themselves that not only defined their domestic competitiveness but also eventually their global competitiveness.

This, I think, was a big turning point, because most of our companies hadn't begun to think of themselves in a truly competitive world -- leave alone a global world, not even an Indian world.

So Telco would be quite happy to let Ashok Leyland increase market share so long as they were doing okay.

Nelco, which at one time had 85% share of the radio market, allowed themselves to come down to 2% by thinking transistors were toys, and stayed in valves; while Bush and others went into transistors.

We focused on ourselves and forgot about the world around. I think perhaps, of all the contribution, that exercise was most valuable -- of forcing companies to have a strategic plan for themselves about where they were going, defend the path which they had decided and meet the criteria that we had set.

Intangibly, this was probably the most important thing that happened. There was a lot of resistance to it in terms of 'What is your locus standi to dictate it to us?' and 'You may have a 26% stake, but how can you tell me to do this and not that?' It became an issue of persuasion and some of these issues are quite significant.

For example, one might be going into passenger cars from trucks. I was there so that wasn't a question of convincing anybody, although that's another story. But let's say Tata Tea going out from the plantation business into branded products.

It was a significant difference, because the mindset at Tata Tea was to grow in the plantation business.

Suddenly it was freed of that and could buy its tea from anywhere, like any other tea company and it could focus on blending and branding products.

Moving Tata Tea from a traditional tea company to a beverage company or a health-based wellness company -- all those have come out of a new mindset of not doing businesses the way you did them earlier or being reactive to your competition, but forging a new path for yourself. I think that was the most significant achievement of the restructuring.

Some of the new businesses that the Tatas entered into -- was the objective to move away from commodity businesses to new businesses with high margins? In that case, a lot of the money is again coming from commodity-type businesses such as Tisco...

I never wanted to move the group away; I was just giving emphasis to inching into new areas.

My hypothesis in the early 1980s was that Jamshetji Tata entered new businesses at the turn of the century -- businesses that Indian companies did not want to enter.

They were indeed heavy industries -- steel, power, textiles, etc, but they broke new ground.

What I was saying was that, in the 1980s, there were new technologies on the horizon such as biotechnology, electronics, computing, artificial intelligence and communications.

So why don't we, at this time, have a new wave for Tatas to get into these businesses? Never did I say - other than getting out of soaps and textiles and in those areas - never did I say that we should get out of steel or anything of that nature.

In fact, what I was advocating at that time, which was not done in the Russi Mody era but was done later, was that we should get into flat products in steel and work up the value chain to high-end steel rather than the conventional construction steel, etc, which Tata Steel was doing those days.

So it's not true that I wanted to move the group away from our traditional businesses.

The Tatas are now at the forefront of international expansion, mainly through aggressive acquisitions. Is this something that happened because you think opportunities in India are not significant or had you always planned on looking for growth outside? What was the origin of this move?

It is part of my plan. You know, I have this annual meeting of communicating with the group and this has been the message over the past three years.

I am delighted that the group has reacted to that. Where it started was ... I forget the years -- I think it was in 1999 when Telco had its big loss.

If you look at my chairman's statement for two to three years, I had kept saying that the kind of growth we have been seeing cannot continue; we will probably see some downturn, but it did not happen. And then it suddenly happened.

When it did, it was quite bad. The market shrank by about 40%. We had 60% share of the market; so what do you do? You can't close down the plant, retrench people, or do any of those things that your counterparts would do abroad.

So we just sat there and bled. We didn't lose market share ... we still had a 65% market share of a shrunk market. But we had capacity that was underutilised.

We had nowhere to turn. That led me to believe that we must not focus on just one economy; we must be able to spread ourselves to multiple economies where this may be done, but that may be difficult. And that led me to say that we cannot be an India-centric group; we must, in fact, start to look very seriously, not just at exports, but at building capacities in serious businesses in other countries. So that was the genesis.

Is there a pitfall to your international expansion?

There is always a pitfall to anything you do. I was going to say, if you take risks, there will be pitfalls; but even if you don't take risks, there can still be pitfalls.

Another thing that I advocated very early when I took over, was that we should look at acquisitions and mergers as an inorganic means of growth, not organic growth alone.

I think globalisation just made the availability of target companies that much bigger than they were in India. That would be the only difference.

You were telling us about Telco, would you tell us how the decision to go into passenger cars came about?

Okay. You know Mr Moolgaonkar (Sumant Moolgaonkar was a legendary former chairman of Telco) and J R D wanted to go into passenger cars much earlier than my involvement in Telco.

I think they put up two or three proposals to the government which were all rejected, because of vested interests from the existing car players. And, as you may recall, Mr Moolgaonkar was actually the founder chairman of Maruti Udyog.

He resigned, I think wrongly, because Maruti looked at passenger cars instead of commercial vehicles.

He thought that there was a need for commercial vehicles in the country, even though it would mean that it was competition for Telco; but because they looked at passenger cars, he thought it was the wrong thing to do and resigned.

I felt that since we already had 60% share of the commercial vehicle business, how much further can we go in that segment? We needed to have another segment.

I always felt that the car segment was going to grow; I felt that the buying public was going to move to cars and I was not wrong.

From selling 50,000 cars a year for so many years, who would have thought that we would produce and sell one million cars in India? So, having been in the television business and seeing that grow, I was quite convinced that the car business was going to be a big business, provided we were at the lower end.

So we set ourselves the task of designing and manufacturing the car, despite the fact that many people said it couldn't be done. And that's how we got into the car business.

And now you are moving down into the Rs one lakh car; do you still think that the big market is at that end?

Well, even when we entered the car business I always felt that about 60% of the market would be at the low end which, indeed, it is.

In fact it's the exact percentage that I had thought. And it's an arbitrary low end because what I said at that time was that it was below Rs four lakh.

So the question is: what is low? You have got the bottom end of that range; the challenge is whether you can change that bottom end and hit a broader base.

Conventional wisdom says no; then you set yourself a task and ask: why not? And suppose you really make an attempt to do that, then you start with a clean sheet of paper and you start looking at all materials and see what you can do to reduce costs.

You use adhesive instead of welding; you look at pigmenting instead of painting; and you look at a whole host of issues like that and wonder why we can't get a car at that kind of price.

If you have a bright team of young people who share that same kind of quest, you realise, yes, you can.

The first thought we had was that of a car that will have no doors, or curtains instead of windows -- not a bad thought.

The genesis of that was: Why should four people endanger their lives by riding a scooter on slippery roads, a child in front and the mother holding a baby at the back? Can there be a better form of transport for them? And can it be at an affordable price?

It wasn't a bad solution -- it would have four wheels, seats and a curtain, so the passengers would be protected against rain. It won't be a car but a four-wheeled transport.

That's how it started. Then, as we went along, it became clear that the consumer will not accept a glorified auto-rickshaw, but is willing to buy a car.

So the doors got added on, the wind-up windows got added, and we finally ended with a car.

Very easy to let the Rs one lakh kind of drift up; but we kept it at the same level. What we would like to offer is a Rs one lakh car and then an up-market version of it which we hope more people will get and may even have things like air-conditioning; but it would still be a very economic car.

The only person who has taken our effort seriously is Mr Carlos Ghosn (then CEO of both Renault and Nissan worldwide) who has recognised that it seems to be happening and that there is virtue in looking at developing a low-cost car in India. But everybody, including Mr Suzuki, said that it is not possible; and that makes it exciting because then it's even more challenging.


You said 25 years ago that there was need for a change in the direction of the group towards technology orientation. Is there need for a new direction today?

You have really caught me off guard. If you were to challenge me, I would say that there may be areas that one may want to enter -- like nuclear power, or retailing or real estate or whatever, wherever there are opportunities -- even alternate fuels, because it reduces our dependence on fossil fuels. But all of those, in a manner of speaking, are mundane extensions of existing businesses.

Today, I think some of us, like Mukesh Ambani, myself and those of us who head industrial units, ought to really focus on what we can really do to make the world a safer place, maybe 50 or 100 years from now. And that brings us to an issue that we should address in our own way.

For instance, how can we deal with climate change and global warming, right now? The effects of it may not be felt now; in fact, we may pay a price for it today, but it will help the generations to follow.

So can we use our visibility to create an awareness of the need to do something? Can we, in our own businesses, be conscious of this and set an example?

For instance, I was, many years ago the prime mover in getting Tata Steel to rid itself of all the emissions that came out of the chimneys at Jamshedpur.

You could not fly over Jamshedpur then, because of all the smog from the chimneys. Today, there is nothing coming out of the chimneys.

We put in anti-pollution equipment and we are very pleased that we could do it. Did it cost us more? Of course, it did cost us an enormous amount more.

Have we improved the quality of life of our employees by removing the red dust that was there everywhere in Jamshedpur -- on all the trees and everywhere? Yes we have. Jamshedpur has become a different place.

Telco, long before my time, planted 2,000 trees -- it was a terrific thing for a company to do what was not related to its business.

Can we create awareness about not polluting our waters? Can we be more sensitive to the environment, not so much by enforcement or by government dictum, but by our own effort? I have been spending a fair amount of time looking at alternate fuels, including hydrogen as a fuel in the future.

I headed a government committee to see if it can be a fuel for motorcars in the coming years.

Can we look at processes that will be kinder to the environment than we have been, and more sensitive? In fact, I am about to create a cell in Tatas that will look at just that and scan the technologies available that will result in success.

Some of these new technologies will, in fact be translated into businesses. But, for most parts, just let's look at our own businesses to see how we can design green buildings that will reduce energy consumption by 'X%'; can we design our factories -- I am talking about what may seem ridiculous today -- but can we put solar panels on the rooftops of all our factories and see if we can harness the sun?

Can we be more self-sufficient in power than we are today? It is these kinds of things that, I think, I would like to create in the short time that I have.

FAREWELL, Mr TATA

"As I talked with Mr. Gandhi, I marvelled at the simplicity of his dress. He wore coarse white cloth, with a Kambal thrown over his body to protect him from the cold. A little white cap was his only head-covering. As he sat on the floor facing me, I asked myself, how can this little man, with his thin face and large protruding ears, and quiet brown eyes, be the great Gandhi about whom I have heard so much. All doubts were set aside when he began to talk. I do not agree with all the methods that Mr. Gandhi employs to bring about the desired end; but I do want to bear this personal testimony of the man himself. Mr. Gandhi is a spiritual man. He is a thinker. In my short interview, I had the same heart-to-heart fellowship with him as I had scores of times with God's saints. I took knowledge that this man had been to the Source of Christian strength and had learned from the great Christ.

"Mr. Gandhi, what can nations of the West do in furthering the all-round development of the East, and particularly of India?" Mr. Gandhi answered the question indirectly, "India is just now in the state of unlearning. She has learnt a lot that is useless and unprofitable. From my observation of the West, and particularly your own country, I have learnt two outstanding facts : First, cleanliness, second, energy. I am fully convinced that my people cannot advance spiritually, until they clean up. Your people are wonderfully energetic. To a large extent, it has been energy after things material. If Indian people could have that same amount of energy rightly directed, they would receive great blessings."

"Mr. Gandhi, will you kindly tell how Christianity can best help India, in view of the spirit of nationalism that is abroad?" He replied, "What we need most of all is sympathy. When I was down in Africa, I found this illustration. I had to dig some artesian wells. In order to search the pure flowing streams, I had to dig deep. Many of the people who come out here to study my people only scratch the surface. If they would dig deep by means of sympathy they would find a stream of life there pure and clean."

"And you will kindly tell me, Mr. Gandhi, what book or person has influenced you the most?" Of course, I Was prepared to hear him say something of the Vedas and several other Indian books with which Christian people should be conversant; but I was not prepared to hear from the lips of the man the mention of three English books that had shaped his life and thought. He frankly confessed that he was not an omnivorous reader, but rather a careful selector of the very best. The order in which he spoke of the books was as follows : The Bible, Ruskin, Tolstoy. Speaking of the Bible he said, "There have been many times when I did not know which way to turn. But I have gone to the Bible and particularly the New Testament, and have drawn strength from its message."

I was anxious to know how our Meerut Graduates' Association, composed of the finest of educated men in the city, could further the city's welfare. In reply to the question, he gave me this one word : Scavenger. He said, "I employ that word in all its meaning.) If the members would get out and lend a helping hand to clean up the city, literally and morally, they would be doing a great work."
