Sentence: but for some reason everybody thought nelco was a failure in a way it was a failure only because it did not grow to become the number one electronics manufacturer in the country because we didnt infuse cash eng

 most Similar Sentence : and we did eng
eculidean distance: 14.6494

Sentence: part of that was because with the exception of j r d tata everybody thought that radios were not the business that the tatas should be in eng

 most Similar Sentence : and we did eng
eculidean distance: 12.1398

Sentence: even though later on it became a television manufacturer eng

 most Similar Sentence : and we did eng
